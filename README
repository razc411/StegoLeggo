README CovertData (StegoLego)
=================================
Simple program for using stegonography to hide data within BMP images. Uses LSB encoding to store the data. Each BMP image can store a max of their pixel size divided by 8. 

Has an encode and decode mode to use:
    covertdata encode "filename.bmp" "data_to_encode"
    covertdata decode "filanem.bmp" "name_of_output"

Decode will print out the original file name of the encoded data.

   gcc
   Linux

To Compile
   gcc *.c -o covertdata

   img_manip.h
   img_manip.c
