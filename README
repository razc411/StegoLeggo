README CovertData (StegoLego)
=================================
Stegolego hides encrypted data within an image and produces time values for each calculation.
Allows the use of multiple symmetric algorithms including tripledes, two fish and rjindael.

To encode and decode data, execute the following commands
    covertdata encode "filename.bmp" "data_to_encode" "algorithm"
    covertdata decode "filanem.bmp" "name_of_output"

For comprehensive information on usage and the algorithms available type
    covertdata -help

All data for encryption and decryption is stored within the "decrypt_times" and
"encrypt_times files created on first run. 

Requires
   gcc
   mcrypt
   Linux

To Compile
   gcc *.c -lmcrypt -o covertdata

Included
   img_manip.h
   img_manip.c
   encrypt.c
   
Installation script is located in the file install_stglego. Execute as so:
    chmod +x install_stglego
    sudo ./install_stglego
